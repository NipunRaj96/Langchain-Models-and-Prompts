# üî• Langchain-Models-and-Prompts

This repository showcases my hands-on journey into the world of **LLMs**, **chat models**, **embeddings**, and **prompt engineering** using **Langchain**. It serves as a practical reference to understand how large language models can be integrated and used effectively for building intelligent applications like chatbots, document similarity tools, and more.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside

- **LLMs**  
  Learned how to load and call large language models from different providers like **Gemini**, **HuggingFace**, and **OpenAI** using Langchain wrappers.

- **Chat Models**  
  Built chat interfaces with models like `ChatHuggingFace` and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, including multi-turn conversations and role-based messages.

- **Chatbots**  
  Created interactive CLI-based chatbot apps using Langchain's `invoke()` method, handling chat history, user prompts, and AI responses.

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Worked on:
  - Static prompts
  - Dynamic prompts
  - Prompt templates using `PromptTemplate` for reusable and modular design.

- **Embedded Models & Document Similarity**  
  Used HuggingFace embedding models like `sentence-transformers` to convert text into vectors and compare similarity using cosine distance.

- **API Integration**  
  Explored how to securely call LLMs by managing API keys through environment variables and using `.env` files.

- **Error Handling & Debugging**  
  Understood various errors (like missing credentials, model not found, API token issues) and how to handle/debug them across providers.
